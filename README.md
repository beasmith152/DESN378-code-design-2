## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log
🔗 **[Learning Log] https://beasmith152.github.io/DESN378-code-design-2**

Update this section each week with observations, breakthroughs, and questions.
### Week 0: The Behavioral Layer
  SUMMARY:
  This file/exercise does two things:

  1. The image changer in this manner allows the user to click on the image and have it change to a different image when clicked through the function used above. Its only const is the source, and it's else is conditionally set to the original image.
  2. The welcome message is standardly set through local storage of what name was used last in case no input is set. Second, if an name is set it changes the content of the h1 where it is positioned to that name. This is all done through the button. The null value code ensures that a name is input before the next step is taken to eliminate possibiltiy of a null. 
​

### What I Learned
Originally, when setting up week 0, I had trouble with the main.js connecting to the html for this particular exercise due to a main.js existing within my structure due to the original page I already began developing. Therefore, I had to change it's path and name to differentiate to main0.js syntax for the week. However, it did work. Same thing with eliminating the const for the initial heading as the const sets a variable making the third exercise not work entirely.
​
​
### What Was Hard
My file structure was originally built for my portfolio, getting the subdomain set up for the new assignments was difficult.
​
​
### How I Used AI
At one point, I did ask co-pilot why my main.js file was not linking to the file for the assignment. It originally thought it was due to the layers such as ../; however, it was actually the filename as a main.js had already existed confusing my directory.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Nothing.

### Week 1: Systems That Respond
Week 1: Systems That respond
SUMMARY: This file/exercise does two things:

The image story was a review of the other week, we ended up adding more than one dynamic element for the project to make a single page interactive story with more options.​​

### What Was Hard
I started with the boilerplate, and wanted to add more features, therefore finding the repeat number in console when the story would repeat and when and where to hide certain features.​​

### How I Used AI
At one point, I did ask co-pilot why my captions were not hiding even when I had >5; however, I realized it needed more parameters.​​

### What's Still Unclear
Nothing.​​

Work Completed (Week 1)

**Engage**
- [✅ ] VS Code Theme Setup

**Learn**
- [ ✅] Codedex.io Variables

### Week 2: Remembering Choices

## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
I learned more about Figma's prototyping through creating variables in their system. Similar to how it would work functionally on the web.
​
​
### What Was Hard
Nothing was too difficult.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I only used AI, in reference to help me remember a call in one of the codex assignments.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Nothing.
